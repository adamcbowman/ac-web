Similar tests were developed elsewhere. The test identifies weak layers and is most effective at finding weak layers near the snow surface. Manual taps applied to a shovel blade placed on top of a snow column cause weak layers within the column to fail. These failures can be seen on the smooth walls of the column. The test can be performed on level or sloping terrain.</p>\n<p>A pit is dug in undisturbed snow to expose a smooth snow wall on a safe slope representative of the slopes of interest. The pit is dug to ground or until well below any possible significant weak layers (often as much as 2 metres deep). The column is not dug down to very weak layers of facets or depth hoar if these layers are likely to fail before upper weak layers of interest.</p>\n<p>A column of snow 30cm wide (across the slope) and 30 cm upslope is created as in the diagram at left. A snow saw can assist in creating the column and making the subsequent backcut that is required. Be sure the visible walls of the column are smooth so that subtle failures can be easily seen.</p>\n<p>A shovel is placed squarely on the surface of the column and progressively harder taps are applied to the shovel blade. Any failures are recorded. Collapse of very thin layers may be subtle and hard to detect. In most cases it is good to have a second person observe for these failures while the first person applies the taps. The size and type of crystals at the failure plane (often from the underside of the block) are also recorded. Another backcut is now made an additional 70cm below the first and the process is repeated to the bottom of the pit. The test may be repeated to verify the results or a <strong>Shovel Shear</strong> Test may be done alongside the first test location.</p>\n<p>The amount of effort required to cause the failure is recorded as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Very Easy (CV) - fails during cutting of column</li>\n<li>Easy (CE) - fails with 5 - 10 light taps using finger tips only</li>\n<li>Moderated (CM) - fails with 5 - 10 moderate taps from elbow using finger tips</li>\n<li>Hard - (CH) - fails with 5 - 10 firm taps from whole arm using palm or first</li>\n<li>Collapse (SC) - block settles when cut</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The primary objective of the compression test is the identification of weak layers. Deeper layers are generally less sensitive to taps on the shovel resulting in higher ratings. Similarly, deeper layers are less sensitive to human triggering. Experience in the Canadian Rockies suggests that layers with \"very easy\" or \"easy\" failures are more often associated with human or explosive triggering than are \"moderate\" or \"hard\" failures. Sudden failures that show up on the column wall as distinct lines seem more likely to indicate potential failure planes than rough or indistinct failures.</p>\n<p>Caution: While the rating of effort needed to have the snow fail in compression may assist with a decision concerning snow failure, it is an inaccurate measurement of slope stability. The ratings of effort are subjective and depend on the strength and stiffness of the slab, on the size and shape of the shovel, the experience of the tester and on whether or not the test site is truly representative of the slope of interest for which the test is being applied.</p>\n<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> If the top surface slopes, test the near surface layers then remove a wedge of snow to level the top of the column. Once level. place the shovel blade squarely on top of the column and continue testing.</p>\n<p>Tapping forces are not transmitted efficiently down through the column, particularly through soft layers within the column. Harder taps are generally required to cause failure in deep layers, particularly if the layers between the shovel and the weak layers contain soft snow.</p>\n<p>Snow below the shovel that crushes and fails to support the shovel squarely should be removed.

In Canada the \"International Classification for Seasonal Snow on the Ground\" (Colbeck, et al, 1990) is generally used to record the snow crystal type: </p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Precipitation Particles</em> are any freshly fallen \"new snow\" type. This can include a wide variety of specific forms that are sub - classified. The size of the individual grains can vary wildly. When the snow crystals have significant \"rime\" attached the small letter \"r\" is added behind the graphical symbol.</li>\n<li><em>Decomposing and fragmented Particles</em> are those snow crystals that have in some way been changed from their original form. This change can be through mechanical action (such as with wind) or through natural processes such as rounding (in which a crystal loses its original form and branches of a crystal can become detached from the original crystal). Parts of the original crystal forms may still be discernible. Decomposing forms are often smaller than the original particles from which they formed.</li>\n<li><em>Rounded Grains</em> are those in which the original form is no longer discernible and the crystal takes on a generally rounded amorphous appearance. Rounded grains typically tend to be smaller grains and are usually significantly smaller than the original grain from which they formed. Typical grain size is often less than 1mm. Commonly referred to as \"rounds\" these grains tend to be found in harder or stronger snowpack layers. Rounded grains typically form when there is a weak temperature gradient in the snowpack (&lt;1 degree / 10 cm). This weak temperature gradient occurs most often in areas where the snowpack is deep and temperatures are mild.</li>\n<li><em><a name=\"facets\" title=\"facets\"></a>Solid Faceted Crystals </em>are those in which the original crystal form is often no longer discernible and the crystals begin to take on an angular, faceted or striated appearance with straight edges and angular corners beginning to predominate. Faceted grains typically tend to be larger grains and are often significantly larger than the grain from which they formed. Typical grain size is often more than 1mm. Commonly referred to as \"facets\" or \"sugar snow\" these grains tend to be found in softer or weaker snowpack layers. Faceted grains typically form when there is a strong temperature gradient in the snowpack (&gt;1 degree / 10 cm). This strong temperature gradient occurs most often in areas where the snowpack is shallow and temperatures are cold. According to Avalanche Accidents in Canada (Geldsetzer and Jamieson), faceted grains and surface hoar are the weak layer in the failure plane in 78% of fatal accidents. These crystals have poor bonds with each other or adjacent layers and persist in the snowpack for a long time until there is adequate load to make them fail.</li>\n<li><em>Cup Shaped Crystals (Depth Hoar)</em> are those in which a faceted form continues to grow or mature in the presence of a strong temperature gradient. These crystals are heavily striated and can have cup or scroll shapes. The grains typically tend to be very large and are often significantly larger than most other grains that would be found in a snowpack. Typical grain size can be more than 3 - 5mm. Commonly referred to as \"depth hoar\" or \"sugar snow\" these grains tend to be found in very soft or very weak snowpack layers usually near the bottom of a weak, shallow snowpack. Depth Hoar forms when there is a strong temperature gradient in the snowpack for a protracted period of time (&gt;1 degree / 10 cm). This strong temperature gradient occurs most often in areas where the snowpack is shallow and temperatures are moderate or cold. According to Avalanche Accidents in Canada (Geldsetzer and Jamieson), <strong>faceted grains</strong> and <strong>surface hoar </strong>are the weak layer in the <strong>failure plane</strong> of slab avalanches in 78% of fatal accidents. Depth Hoar crystals have very poor bonds with each other or adjacent layers and can persist in the snowpack until the end of winter or until there is adequate load to make them fail. These grains can be the weakness in avalanches that fail right at the ground, in which the entire winter snowpack is involved in a large climax type of avalanche.</li>\n<li><em>Wet Grains</em> are just as the name implies... WET. They form when temperatures are above freezing, when solar radiation is intense, when rain falls onto the snowpack or when any of these factors occurs individually or together. The original crystal shape is often rapidly changed and rounded. While grains are warm and wet they tend to be weak and can fail in wet loose avalanches or wet slab avalanches.</li>\n<li><em>Feathery Crystals (Surface Hoar)</em> form on the surface of the snow under conditions where there is a generally clear sky with high humidity and little or no wind. These crystals are the same as the \"hoar frost\" seen sparkling on trees and on the snow surface after a clear cold night. They can be large in size (&gt;10mm) or smaller (&lt;1mm). As a broad generalization, the larger the size of surface hoar the more likely that it will form a poor bond to the adjacent snow layer. Once buried under a new snow layer they can be difficult to detect without diligent testing. According to Avalanche Accidents in Canada (Geldsetzer and Jamieson), <strong>faceted grains</strong> and surface hoar are the weak layer in the failure plane in 78% of fatal accidents. These crystals have poor bonds with each other or adjacent layers and persist in the snowpack for a long time until there is adequate load to make them fail.</li>\n<li><em>Ice Masses</em> often form when a wet layer cools and hardens.</li>\n<li><em>Surface Deposits and Crusts</em> is a broad category that includes sun crust, wind crust, rain crust, rime and other melt / freeze crusts.

For example, to gain information about a wind blown slope, find a safe part of a similarly loaded slope for a test. The site should not contain buried ski or snowmobile tracks, avalanche deposits, etc. or be within about 5 m or trees where the buried layers might be disturbed by wind action or by clumps of snow which have fallen from nearby trees. Although Dr. P. Fohn (1987) recommends slope angles of at least 30 degrees, rutschblocks of 25 - 30 degrees may also give useful information (discussed below).

However, if the side walls are to be cur with a ski, pole, cord or saw, the lower wall should be about 2.1 m across and the top of the side cuts should be about 1.9m apart. This flaring of the block ensures it is free to slide without binding at the sides. The lower wall should be a smooth surface cut with a shovel. Dig or cut the side walls and the upper wall deeper than any weak layers that may be active. If the side walls are exposed by shoveling, then one rutschblock test may require 20 or more minutes for two people.</p>\n<p>If the weak layers of interest are within 60cm of the surface, time can be saved by cutting both the sides and the upper wall of the block with a ski pole (basket removed) or with the tail of a ski. If the weak layers are deeper than 60cm and the overlying snow does not contain any knife-hard crusts, both the sides and the upper wall of the block can be sawed with cord which travels up one side, around ski poles or probes placed at both upper corners of the block and down the other side.</p>\n<p>The rutschblock is loaded, and failure recorded, in the following sequence:</p>\n<p>R1 - the block slides during digging or cutting <br />R2 - the skier (or snowboarder) approaches the block from above and gently steps down onto the upper part of the block (within 35cm of the upper wall). <br />R3 - without lifting the heels, the skier drops from straight knee to bent knee position, pushing downwards and compacting surface layers. <br />R4 - The skier (or snowboarder) jumps up and lands on the same compacted spot. <br />R5 - The skier jumps again onto the same compacted spot. <br />R6 - for hard or deep slabs, remove skis and jump on the same spot. / - for soft slabs or thin slabs where jumping without skis might penetrate the slab, keep the skis on, step down another 35 cm, almost to mid block and push once then jump three times. <br />R7 - none of the loading steps produced a smooth slope-parallel failure. <br />Interpretation of rutschblock tests in the starting zone:</p>\n<p>1, 2 or 3: Block fails before the first jump. It is likely that slopes with similar snow conditions can be released by a skier, snowboarder, snowshoer or snowmobile. <br />4 or 5: The block fails on first or second jump. The stability of the slope is suspect. It is possible that slopes with similar snow conditions can be released by a skier, snowboarder, snowshoer or snowmobile. Other observations or tests must be used to assess the slab stability. (Snowmobiles have increased risk or staring avalanches when compared to skiers.) <br />6 or 7: the block does not fail on the first or second jump. There is a low (but not negligible) risk of skier, snowboarder, snowshoer or snowmobile triggering of avalanches on slopes with similar snow conditions. Other field observations and test as well as safety measures remain appropriate. <br />We should be very careful with interpreting slope tests since they overestimate the slope stability at least 10% of the time. (Jamieson, 2000)</p>\n<p>The rutschblock is a good slope test but it is not a one stop stability evaluation. The test does not eliminate the need for snow profiles or careful field observations nor does it, in general, replace other slope tests such as ski cutting and explosive tests.</p>\n<p>The rutschblock only tests those layers deeper than ski or snowboard penetration. For example, a weak layer 20 cm below the surface is not tested by skis which penetrate 20cm or more. Higher and more variable rutschblock scores are sometimes observed near the top of a slope where layering may differ from the middle and lower part of the slope (Jamieson and Johnston, 1993). Higher scores may contribute to an incorrect decision.</p>\n<p>Rutschblock results are easiest to interpret if the tests are done in avalanche starting zones. However, since there is a general tendency for rutschblock scores to increase by 1 for each 10 degree decrease in slope angle (Jamieson and Johnston, 1993), scores for avalanche slopes can be estimated from safer, less steep slopes (as shallow as 25 degrees). Note that rutschblocks done on slopes of less than 30 degrees require a smooth lower wall and a second person standing in or near the pit to observe the small displacements (often less than 1 cm) that indicate a shear failure.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: xx-small;\"><em>Text and diagram modified after \"Advanced Avalanche Safety Course Manual\" Copyright</em> <em>&copy; 1998 Canadian Avalanche Association.

The height of the snowpack is 100cm and the snow temperature near the top of the snowpack is -15 degrees C. This creates an \"average\" temperature gradient within this snowpack of 1.5 degrees / 10cm. The actual gradient in any particular layer varies and may be greater or less than this average, but it can be expected that in this sample snowpack the faceting process will be predominating.

Faceted grains and depth hoar formed in this way will persist in the snowpack and can cause cycles of avalanche activity for the rest of the winter and even into the spring or, in some cases, summer.</p>\n<p><strong>Weak Temperature Gradient</strong></p>\n<p>The cross section of a snowpack at left shows a weak temperature gradient.

There is no place in this sample snowpack that the faceting process will be predominating. </p>\n<p>This example is fairly typical of a snowpack that you may find in early winter in a deep snowpack region with moderate climate (such as the Coast Ranges of British Columbia or the US). Similarly this type of snowpack may exist in the Columbia Mountains in the Interior of British Columbia in early winter during a heavy snowfall winter and certainly by mid winter in an average winter. The Canadian Rockies would typically only have this type of condition later in winter or spring or in a good snow year.</p>\n<p>If this temperature gradient does not change, the snowpack will continue to gain strength over time and any base of weaker facets as shown in this example will continue to strengthen. Even with a weak temperature gradient which promotes rounding and strengthening of the snowpack, hidden weak layers may exist. In this sample snowpack, a layer of surface hoar is buried just above 130cm. Buried surface hoar may persist in the snowpack and can cause cycles of avalanche activity for the next several weeks or more. The weak temperature gradient will eventually round out the surface hoar and promote bonding with the layers above and below but this gain in strength of this insidious layer can take a very long time in some cases. </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: xx-small;\"><em>Text by Cyril Shokoples / Diagrams from \"Avalanche Safety Course Overheads\" Copyright &copy; 1998 Canadian Avalanche Association</em></span></p>\n</span></p>", "title": "Temperature Gradient"}, {"content": "<p>A terrain feature that increases the consequences of getting caught in an avalanche.
