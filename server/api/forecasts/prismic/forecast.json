This layer consists of surface hoar (weak, feathery crystals) and facets. The layer also likely consists of a crust on south facing slopes. Avalanche activity on this layer has slowed, but test results still indicate that this layer may still be possible to human trigger in specific locations. It has been most reactive at lower elevations below treeline.</span></p><p class=\"p_CC664AAA\"><span class=\"s_E6FD2046\">The lower snowpack is generally considered to be strong, except for shallow, rocky areas where the cold temperatures continue to facet (weaken) the snowpack. </span></p>",
