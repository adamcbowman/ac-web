The rider's use of an airbag pack appears to have aided a quick and successful companion rescue effort. Clearing weather on Sunday also allowed for observations of several natural storm slab releases just southwest of Valemount. These reached size 2.5 and were mainly confined to steep alpine features, but in some cases ran to valley bottom. </span></p><p class=\"p_CC664AAA\"><span class=\"s_3FE45715\">Prior to the storm, a few large (size 2-3) natural persistent slab avalanches were reported last Sunday. These avalanches were reported on south aspects in the alpine. Last week numerous persistent slab avalanches (up to size 3) were reported on all aspects. The persistent slabs were 50-150 cm thick and likely failed on the early December weak layer. </span><span class=\"s_3FE45715\">The inability of our recent storm to produce a renewal of persistent slab activity suggests that this layer may finally have become dormant.</span></p><p class=\"p_CC664AAA\"><span class=\"s_3FE45715\">Looking forward, anticipate the potential for human triggering to remain elevated. The existence of surface hoar beneath our new snow is likely to prolong unstable conditions.</span></p>",

In many areas, the new snow will overlie a weak layer of surface hoar that was reportedly widespread at treeline and above in advance of the storm. This weak interface covers a few cm of storm snow from light snowfalls in days prior to the storm.</span></p><p class=\"p_CC664AAA\"><span class=\"s_3FE45715\">Avalanche activity on the 110-180 cm deep weak layer that formed during the dry spell in early December has greatly diminished over the last week. This layer is composed of weak facets, surface hoar, and a sun crust on steep south-facing slopes. It is believed to be trending toward a dormant state after the loading test brought by Saturday's storm failed to produce consistent reports of avalanches 'stepping down'. Places that might still challenge this assumption of dormancy would be steep north and east facing slopes between 1900-2300 m and steep south-facing slopes in the alpine</span></p><p class=\"p_CC664AAA\"><span class=\"s_3FE45715\">A weak layer from mid-November and a crust that formed in late October are found near the bottom of the snowpack. The probability of triggering these deeper layers is low, but the most suspect areas would be shallow spots in steep, rocky terrain.</span></p>",
